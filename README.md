Hi! This application is an example of a full-fledged online store consisting of a server and a client part. I used Strape as a server, the client part is written in React, relax.
The styling is done mainly on @mui/material.

To launch the application, you need to install the dependency package in the application terminal using the npm install command.
Next, enter npm start in the client folder.
In order for the client part to take the necessary data from the server, you will need to log in to strapi.
